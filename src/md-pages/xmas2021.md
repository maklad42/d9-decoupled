Another fantastic Christmas for the Anderson Clan!

Asako and I were up at around 4am to put the presents under the tree. We were back asleep by 5am for another couple of hours of much needed sleep.

We were surprised when the kids didn't waken till nearer 8am, but their reaction when they woke up and saw the pile of presents was well worth it.

Everyone was delighted with the haul, and Fiona's present were perfect for everyone. I especially like the Scotland box that will look great on my desk. I am also really looking forward to reading the Dave Grohl autobiography. The first few pages are very well written and I know that he must have a wealth of stories to draw on.
