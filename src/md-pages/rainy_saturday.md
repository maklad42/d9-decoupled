Two items that have no immediate connection to each other.

But, ...

today was a rainy Saturday, and with football practice cancelled, I had no real plans. I managed to fill my day quite happily with some PES 2021 Become A Legend games in the morning followed by a walk listening to some SyntaxFM podcast goodness.

All in all not a bad Saturday after all.
